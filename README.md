## Toolchain

from https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

### Creating a Toolchain from Scratch
A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

A package manager, such as Yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
A bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.

If you prefer to set up your own JavaScript toolchain from scratch, [check out this guide](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658) that re-creates some of the Create React App functionality.

Donâ€™t forget to ensure your custom toolchain [is correctly set up for production](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build).
